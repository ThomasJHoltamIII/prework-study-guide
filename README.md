## PS

This was actually more fun than I anticipated, I was pretty worried it would be majorly hard. I suppose the ramp up will come later in the actual course, however I was pleased to find out that the programming I had done in High School, which was mostly in a modified JavaScript language, was hugely helpful in following along with the coursework that helped me build this study guide. I am looking forward to ramping up and to look back on this as a starting point. It's always exciting to start on something daunting and I hope to one day have a sharp skill set that started right here. I'm pretty sure maybe only a future instructor will ever give this README a passing glance, and if so or if not I hope the reader is well.

Thanks for reading!
